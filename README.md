# AirBnB-Seattle
When visiting a new place, one of the important choices is to decide where to stay. You're probably unfamiliar with the city or have other constraints like a budget. This analysis tries to address this and helps users get a better overview of where accommodations are located and which neighbourhoods would fit their needs. This repo contains an analysis of AirBnB data of Seattle from the perspective of a potential visitor. 

To summarise the analysis, if you are on a budget, stay away from downtown. Even though University District and Maple Leaf are much cheaper, they also tend to not be good value for money and don't get very good reviews. You are probably best off staying somewhere in the North West if price matters to you.

Please see the notebook for a more detailed analysis and visuals by either going there directly or clicking on the [link](https://github.com/AleKosc/AirBnB-Seattle/blob/master/AirBnB%20Seattle.ipynb). I also wrote a blog on [Medium](https://medium.com/@ale.kosciansky/where-to-stay-in-seattle-with-airbnb-46392bab3c08).

I used the following libraries:

  - pandas --> handle/manipulate data
  - numpy --> handle/manipulate data
  - matplotlib.pyplot --> data visualisation
  - seaborn --> data visualisation
  - folium --> plot maps and datapoints

The datasets are:

  - listings: all accomodations, locations, scores etc.
  - reviews: not used. Additional review information
  - calendar: not used. Availability of accomodations
